The Health Insurance industry underwrites (i.e. assumes the risks of and assigns premiums for) health and medical insurance policies. Insurance is the transfer of the risk of a loss in exchange for payment. Operators also provide administrative services for self-funded insurance plans (whereby an employer provides health benefits to workers with its own funds). 

An Insurance industry consisting of carriers of private, group and public health, medical, dental insurance, was plagued with the disease of slow growth five years ago as a result of reduced employer coverage and an over extended consumer. However, consistent increases in health care expenditure and medical cost inflation, as well as a sharp decline in the uninsured rate, have driven industry growth in recent years.

Most industry revenue is generated from premiums that are related to fully funded insurance policies. Under this traditional coverage, the health insurer assumes financial responsibility for paying all the incurred coverage benefits and administration costs of health care benefits. In return, the company receives a premium. Health insurers also generate income by providing network-based health and well-being services to beneficiaries in government-sponsored health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.

The U.S. insurance industry’s net premiums written totaled $1.2 trillion in 2015, with premiums recorded by life/health (L/H) insurers accounting for 55 percent and premiums by property/casualty (P/C) insurers accounting for 45 percent, as per S&P Global Market Intelligence. 
Due to the Affordable Care Act enacted by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010, Employers find themselves covering a higher percentage of their employee’s health insurance cost than in previous years. Despite incentives, such as tax breaks and tax credits, offered to small businesses via the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP), many employers still find the mandate to be a financial burden.  So much of a burden that many businesses, large and small, have laid off or re-purposed employees, reduced employee hours (full-time to part-time), or relocated operations to states or even other countries to offset the cost incurred due to the health insurance mandate.
