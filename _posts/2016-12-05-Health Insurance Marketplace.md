title: Health Insurance Marketplace Race

The Health Insurance industry underwrites (i.e. assumes the risks of and assigns premiums for) health and medical insurance policies. Insurance is the transfer of the risk of a loss in exchange for payment. Operators also provide administrative services for self-funded insurance plans (whereby an employer provides health benefits to workers with its own funds). 
The Health and Medical Insurance industry, which/THAT is made up of carriers of private, group and public health, medical, dental insurance, was characterized by slow growth five years ago as a result of reduced employer coverage and continued consumer de-leveraging. However, consistent increases in health care expenditure and medical cost inflation, as well as a sharp decline in the uninsured rate, have driven industry growth in recent years.
